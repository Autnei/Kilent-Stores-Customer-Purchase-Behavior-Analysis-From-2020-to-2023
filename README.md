# Kilent-Stores-Customer-Purchase-Behavior-Analysis-From-2020-to-2023
This project analyzed customer purchases by gender, product category, and region, identifying clothing as the top category, female customers as primary buyers, and France as the leading market.

The key insights uncovered from this analysis include:

**KEY INSIGHTS**

The sum of purchase amounts has remained relatively stable from 2020 to 2023, ranging from $562k to $582k, with a slight decline in 2021 ($558k) and a recovery in 2023 ($571k).

Clothing is the leading product category in purchase amount with approximately $391.2k in purchases, followed by Sports and Books.

France leads in purchase amount, with a total of $410.96k, followed closely by Canada ($380.53k) and Germany ($374.74k).

Certain categories perform better in specific regions; for example, Clothing consistently shows high purchase amounts across multiple countries, while categories like Sports and Electronics have varied performance by country.

**RECOMMENDATIONS**

Introduce seasonal or year-end promotions to boost purchases during low-activity periods. Investigate customer retention strategies to encourage repeat purchases and possibly reach a year-over-year increase.

Increase inventory and marketing focus on clothing to capitalize on its popularity. Introduce exclusive clothing promotions and discounts to attract even more buyers. Consider exploring customer preferences within each category to personalize offerings further.

Strengthen marketing efforts in France to maintain its lead. For countries with lower purchase amounts, like Australia ($369.66k) and the UK ($365.49k), consider localized campaigns to enhance brand visibility and encourage growth.

Customize product recommendations based on each countryâ€™s preferred categories to increase relevance. Country-specific ads should highlight top-selling products to better engage local markets.
